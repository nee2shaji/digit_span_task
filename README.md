# Effect of Languages on Digit Span Task (Hindi and English)

## Task Description
Digit Span measures verbal short-term memory - the systems that allows temporary strage of information. In this study, we examine the digit span task in a set of 26 bilingual individuals, fluent in both Hindi and English. We test the digit span task performance in these bilingual individuals. Majority of these individuals have Hindi as their mother tongue. In spite of this, it is seen that performance in English is better for longer digit spans for both groups.

## Procedure & Results
The experiment was website based and was developed using jsPsych, JavaScript library for running behavioral experiments in a web browser.
Result dataset is in digitspan_user_data.csv. Results show that digit span is longer in English than in Hindi. Possible explanation for the longer span in English can be attributed to the facts that the subjects might be more familiar or have affinity towards English digits in daily usage. Baddeley et. al. showed that the number of words an individual can hold in short-term memory is limited by the amount of time it takes to pronounce the words. This might have an effect on bilingual speakers fluent in both languages Hindi as well as English.
